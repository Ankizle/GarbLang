# Garblang

This is a very unstable programming language that I made for my Science Research class of 2021.

The syntax is very similar to assembly, both having labels to accomplish any task, but it doesn't make the same concept of different sections, such as bss, data, and text.

The main part of this project is it's calculation of locations to garbage collect at compile time. I would love to implement more algorithms, to check if a stack allocation would be faster, or if a variable can be deallocated earlier, but sadly, I didn't have the time.

Syntax for this language is also unstable, and very incoherent. If I get more time in the future to add more syntactic sugar, I will most definitely do that.

If you want to learn more about this, or try to understand how this language even works, the source code is available, but very hard to understand.
